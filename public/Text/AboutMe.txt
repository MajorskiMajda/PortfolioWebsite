I’m a full-stack web developer with a passion for designing websites. I have two adorable pugs, and when I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hanging out with them. Before diving into web development, I worked as a designer and editor for a few years, but I didn’t feel fully fulfilled in that role. So, I decided to make a big change in my life.

At first, I was only interested in front-end development, but I soon realized that understanding the back-end made coding so much easier and helped me design better websites. The more I learned, the more I realized I wanted to be a well-rounded developer, so I’ve embraced both front-end and back-end development.

In the next five years, my goal is to settle into a role as a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer, and work my way up to a senior web developer position. I’m always excited to learn new things and improve my skills, and I’m committed to growing as a developer.

I’m fluent in English and have some Spanish under my belt. I’m also a night owl and don’t mind working across different time zones. Thanks so much for visiting my website!
